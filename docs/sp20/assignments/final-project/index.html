                    <h4>Summary:</h4>
                    <p>Create a website. That's it!*</p>

                    <p>*Ok there are few guidelines, but this is largely an open-ended project with some minimum technical requirements. I want you to use this final as an opportunity to make something that interests you. The goal of this project is not to create the World's Greatest Website (although you can totally go for that), but to demonstrate that you can put together a functioning, responsive website.</p>

                    <h4>Guidelines:</h4>
                    <p>No matter what sort of website you make, it must meet the following minimum requirements to get full credit:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Minimum 2 HTML pages.</strong> These pages should be linked together so a user can navigate between them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum 1 CSS stylesheet.</strong> While you might have multiple stylesheets for different pages or screen sizes, you can technically put all your CSS in one file.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum 1 Javascript file.</strong> Your Javascript must use jQuery.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum 1 external library (in addition to jQuery).</strong> For example, <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">animate.css</a> or <a href="https://p5js.org" target="_blank">p5js</a> (but feel free to find your own).</li>
                        <li><strong>A scrolling event using jQuery.</strong> (tutorial video coming soon).</li>
                        <li><strong>An animated element.</strong> You can do a traditional animation in CSS, or use jQuery+animate.css.</li>
                        <li><strong>A modal popout window.</strong> (video tutorial coming soon).</li>
                        <li><strong>A toggle event using jQuery.</strong> (video tutorial coming soon).</li>
                        <li><strong>A favicon on each page.</strong> The favicon is the little icon that appears on your browser tab. (video tutorial coming soon).</li>
                        <li><strong>A brief project statement (or "about" section).</strong> A couple sentences (or more) describing the "why" of the project (doesn't need to be serious). If you're making a portfolio, you should have some sort of bio, artist statement, or statement of purpose.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In addition to your website including those elements, it must also do the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Your website must be hosted as a GitHub pages site.</strong> Create a new GitHub repository specifically for this project. The link you turn in should be a publicly-accessible link that anyone can access.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your website should just "work."</strong> That means that all your links should work, we should be able to figure out how it works without having someone explain it to us, your positioning should function how you intend it to, things should be sized appropriately, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your website should work on both mobile and desktop environments.</strong> Keep in mind both portrait and landscape phone orientations, as well as wide and narrow desktop windows. Be sure to test out multiple sizes when you write your code. The majority of website traffic is now through mobile devices, not desktops, so keep that in mind!</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="highlight">Option 1: A Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>Create your portfolio website! Think about an effective way to present your work on a website, whether that's writing, design, film, art, etc. Portfolio websites come in all shapes and sizes, from the <a href="https://www.dougaitkenworkshop.com/" target="_blank">minimal</a> and <a href="http://merijnhos.com/" target="_blank">straightforward</a> to the <a href="https://robbiebarrat.github.io/" target="_blank">vintage</a>, <a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/#CenterOfTheUniverse" target="_blank">elaborate</a> and downright <a href="https://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/" target="_blank">impossible</a> to navigate (though sometimes that's part of the appeal).</p>
                    <p>Think about your portfolio site as both a place to present your work and as an expressive work in itself.</p>

                    <h2 class="highlight">Option 2: A Web "tool"</h2>
                    <p>Create a web tool, or a website with some specific purpose. I use the term 'tool' loosely, as some of the examples listed below have pretty <a href="http://www.ismycomputeron.com/" target="_blank">narrow</a> uses, and many are largely useless. (Note, some of the below examples wouldn't meet the minimum techincal requirements for this project, but conceptually they fit the bill.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="example-link" href="https://www.isitraining.org/" target="_blank">isitraining.org</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="http://make-everything-ok.com/">make-everything-ok.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="http://www.ismycomputeron.com/" target="_blank">ismycomputeron.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/" target="_blank">hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="https://isitchristmas.com/" target="_blank">isitchristmas.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/" target="_blank">donothingfor2minutes.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="https://fallingguy.com/" target="_blank">fallingguy.com</a> <a class="example-link" href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/" target="_blank">donothingfor2minutes.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="https://www.online-stopwatch.com/interval-timer/">online-stopwatch.com</a>
                        <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/" target="_blank" class="example-link">theuselessweb.com</a>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="highlight">Option 3: A work of Web Art/net.art</h2>
                    <p>A piece of <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/" target="_blank">web art/net.art</a> (using the web as an artistic medium) or a creatively "useless" website that does something kind of neat.</p>
                    <p>
                        <a class="example-link" href="https://www.rrrgggbbb.com/" target="_blank">rrrgggbbb.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="https://pointerpointer.com/">pointerpointer.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="http://intotime.com/" target="_blank">intotime.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="https://therevolvinginternet.com/" target="_blank">therevolvinginternet.com</a>
                        <a class="example-link" href="http://endless.horse/" target="_blank">endless.horse</a>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="highlight">Option 4: Educational or Fan Site</h2>
                    <p>Know a bunch about a topic and you're just dying to share? Now's your chance! This could be a fan site of something/somehwere/someone you admire or enjoy, or a topic to which you want to bring awareness. This site can be totally serious and factual, or completely ridiculous.</p>

                    <h2 class="highlight">Option 5: Other</h2>
                    <p>Surprise me!</p>

                    <h3>How are we presenting our projects?</h3>
                    <p>If we were still meeting for class in person, we would each be presenting our final web pages in front of the class. I'd still like to do that! During our last class on Monday, we'll be meeting over Zoom and taking turns presenting our websites. You'll each have up to ten minutes to present your site and get feedback.</p>

                    <p>I want our last class to be a low-pressure fun time. The presentations are meant to be a super informal chance to show off your hard work! It'll be our last shared time together as a class, so let's enjoy it :)</p>
                      
                    <h3>Timeline</h3>
                    <p>Here's a timeline with some milestones designed to help you work through this project incrementally. Required milestones are assignments worth 10 points each (see the assignments page for more info). Optional milestones are there to help you stay on track, and don't need to be turned in.</p>

                    <p><b>Points: 30% of your grade</b></p>
                    <p><b>Due: Sunday, 05/10 @ 11:59pm</b></p>
                    
                    <h4>How to receive full credit:</h4>
                    <p>Satisfy all the minimum requirements listed above.</p>

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Have fun with this assignment! Use this as an opportunity to help yourself if you want! Maybe you're working on getting started as a freelancer, or you're trying to build some kind of side hustle you need a website for. Make the website for that thing you need in your life. Or again, just make something ridiculous. As long as it's a working website, that's all I really care about it.</p>
