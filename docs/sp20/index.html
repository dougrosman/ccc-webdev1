                <p>Each Monday, beginning at your usual class time (12:30pm or 3:30pm CST). Online lectures will last around 45-60 minutes. Check the schedule <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eIPgAc0Sy6ao-QSCeWG_ndXEAjusvi6nJ7OydNAeMGE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</p>
                
                <a name="lectures"><br></a>
                <h3 class="highlight">How do I attend online lectures?</h3>
                <p>Through Zoom! Check the <a href="https://canvas.colum.edu/" target="_blank">Canvas</a> homepage for the Zoom meeting link. Click the Zoom link to join the waiting room, and I'll admit you. Make sure to click the 'join with computer audio' button when you first join the meeting.</p>
                
                <a name="conduct"><br></a>
                <h3 class="highlight">How should I conduct myself in Zoom lectures?</h3>
                <p>Video and microphone are gladly accepted if possible–I love seeing your faces! You should be muted by default in the meeting so that we can avoid ambient background sound, as well as talking over each other, but you can press your spacebar to temporarily unmute yourself if you have questions or comments. If there are aren't too many people, feel free to keep your mic open.</p>
                <p>If you can't or don't wish to participate via audio or video, that's fine too! Use the chat window during the meeting to participate.</p>

                <a name="mandatory"><br></a>
                <h3 class="highlight">Is attending online lectures mandatory?</h3>
                <p>No! Lectures will be recorded and posted Monday evenings on the class website <a href="https://dougrosman.github.io/ccc-webdev1/sp20/lectures/">here</a> so you can watch them on your own time. But I will still be taking "attendance." See below.</p>

                <a name="present"><br></a>
                <h3 class="highlight">How can I be marked present each week?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whether or not you attend class "live" or watch a recording later, you must take a quick weekly Canvas quiz with questions related to the lecture. <strong>You have until the last day of the semester, May 15 @ 11:59pm to take these quizzes.</strong></li>
                    <li>If you <strong>cannot</strong> attend class live, please message me on Discord either before class or by 10:00pm Tuesday the day after class. No worries if you can't attend class live, I just want to stay connected with all of you! :)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Once you've done these two things, I'll mark you as present in Canvas. (I'll be more lenient with this first week)</p>

                <a name="attendance"><br></a>
                <h3 class="highlight">How does attendance affect my grade?</h3>
                <p>Attendance going forward will count as 10% of your grade. <strong>Your attendance record from the pre-quarantine "before-time" will all be counted as present. Clean slate for everyone!</strong></p>

                <a name="assignments"><br></a>
                <h3 class="highlight">How will assignments work in this class?</h3>
                <p>Each assignment I post will have a clear due date, instructions for how to turn it in, and a list of expectations for receiving full credit.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">What is the school-wide grading policy?</h3>
                <p><strong>From the provost:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>The deadline to declare a class (or classes) Pass/Fail is Friday, May 1st.</em></li>
                    <li><em>It is optional to declare a class Pass/Fail…it is not mandatory to declare classes Pass/Fail.</em></li>
                    <li><em>If you decide to declare a class Pass/Fail, your faculty member can only assign you a grade of “P” (for Pass) or “F” (for Fail)…but faculty will not be able to assign A, B, C, D grades.</em></li>
                    <li><em>A “P” grade will have no impact on your semester or cumulative GPA, you will simply earn the credits in the class and towards graduation.</em></li>
                    <li><em>The “F” grade is still a failing grade and it will definitely impact your Semester and Cumulative GPA.</em></li>
                    <li><em>The “P” grade in the Spring 2020 is different because it will fulfill major and minor requirements, as well as prerequisites for future classes (typically a “P” grade at Columbia does not meet those requirements).</em></li>
                    <li><em>To designate this special Spring 2020 “P” grade – it will actually be recorded on your Academic Record as a “PX” grade.</em></li>
                    <li><em>Students who are seeking to improve their GPA this semester may decide the P/F is not the best the option for them, because the “P” grade will have no impact on your GPA.</em></li>
                    <li><em>Once a student declares a course as Pass/Fail, it cannot be converted back to a standard letter-graded course.</em></li>
                    <li><em>There is no limit to the number of courses a student declares as Pass/Fail.</em></li>
                    <li><em>To consider the pros/cons of the Pass/Fail option, we encourage all students to speak with their assigned Academic Advisor in the <a href="https://students.colum.edu/academic-services/advising/index?utm_source=All+Faculty+and+Staff&utm_campaign=ecc0f1e7e8-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_07_10_19&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ba8ab9bd51-ecc0f1e7e8-104224721" target="_blank">College Advising Center</a> or directly with your course faculty member. Finally, if you wish to declare a class Pass/Fail, you can find instructions and the form on the <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolum.us4.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D1465047989636e1d02918aca5%26id%3D2edeb0c688%26e%3Dc9729a1bb3&data=02%7C01%7Cdrosman%40colum.edu%7Cf0b9ac81ec254a10818a08d7dbdbac62%7C243ef28877994efcaff5fde4e3f1c98d%7C1%7C0%7C637219608843131138&sdata=SHBbBCebwLNAw0oesCuK1mUWl2Vh9kKF4Szr3lsNP5U%3D&reserved=0" target="_blank"> Columbia Central website</a>.</em></li>
