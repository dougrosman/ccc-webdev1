                <h2>Updated Guidelines for Online Class</h2>
                
                <h3>When is class being held?</h3>
                <p>Each Monday, beginning at your usual class time (12:30pm or 3:30pm CST). Online lectures will last around 45-60 minutes. Check the schedule <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eIPgAc0Sy6ao-QSCeWG_ndXEAjusvi6nJ7OydNAeMGE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                
                <h3>How do I attend online lectures?</h3>
                <p>Through Zoom! Check the <a href="https://canvas.colum.edu/" target="_blank">Canvas</a> homepage for the Zoom meeting link. Click the Zoom link to join the waiting room, and I'll admit you. Make sure to click the 'join with computer audio' button when you first join the meeting.</p>
                
                <h3>How should I conduct myself in Zoom lectures?</h3>
                <p>Video and microphone are gladly accepted if possibleâ€“I love seeing your faces! You should be muted by default in the meeting so that we can avoid talking over each other and ambient background sound, but you can press your spacebar to temporarily unmute yourself if you have questions or comments. If there are aren't too many people, feel free to keep your mic open.</p>
                <p>If you can't or don't wish to participate via audio or video, that's fine too! Use the chat window during the meeting to participate.</p>

                <h3>Is attending online lectures mandatory?</h3>
                <p>No! They will be recorded and posted Monday evenings on the class website <a href="https://dougrosman.github.io/ccc-webdev1/sp20/lectures/">here</a> so you can watch them on your own time. But I will still be taking "attendance." See below.</p>

                <h3>How can I be marked present each week?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whether or not you attend class "live" or watch a recording later, you must take a quick weekly Canvas quiz with questions related to the lecture. <strong>You have until the last day of the semester, May 15 @ 11:59pm to take these quizzes.</strong></li>
                    <li>If you <strong>cannot</strong> attend class live, please message me on Discord either before class or by 10:00pm Tuesday the day after class. No worries if you can't attend class live, I just want to stay connected with all of you! :)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Once you've done these two things, I'll mark you as present in Canvas. (I'll be more lenient with this first week)</p>

                <h3>How does attendance affect my grade?</h3>
                <p>Attendance going forward will count as 10% of your grade. <strong>Your attendance record from the pre-quarantine "before-time" will all be counted as present. Clean slate for everyone!</strong></p>

                <h3>How will assignments work in this class?</h3>
                <p>Each assignment I post will have a clear due date, instructions for how to turn it in, and a list of expectations for receiving full credit.</p>
